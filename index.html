            <h2> Why This Blog Exists</h2>
            <p>
        This blog is more than just code and content — it's a living journal of classroom experiments, student voices, and the messy magic of learning. I created it to share what we're building, thinking, and feeling as we grow together in tech and life. You'll find reflections, resources, and maybe even a few surprises along the way and the best part?</p>

        <p>My students will be creating their own blogs too — each one a unique window into their world. So stay tuned, explore freely, and let curiosity lead the way</p>
